# Propositional Idea Density

This folder contains `PID_rater.py` and `prep.py`, which were authored by Silke Marckx,
and kindly shared with us.

* We rewrote `prep.py` as `prep2.py` to make it more readable and compatible with the Frog output.
* We edited `PID_rater.py` to directly output the scores for both Dutch datasets.

If you plan to use the PID rater in your own research, please cite Marckx's thesis:
