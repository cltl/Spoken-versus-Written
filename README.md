# Varying image description tasks: spoken versus written descriptions
*Emiel van Miltenburg, Ruud Koolen, and Emiel Krahmer*

This folder contains all the code and data to reproduce the results from our paper.
There are two subfolders:

* `Dutch` contains all the code and data for the analysis of the Dutch descriptions.
* `English` contains all the code and data for the analysis of the English descriptions.

Both these folders contain `README.md` files with more detailed instructions.
