# Varying image description tasks: spoken versus written descriptions
*Emiel van Miltenburg, Ruud Koolen, and Emiel Krahmer*

## General
Our paper explores the differences between spoken and written image descriptions,
for two languages: English and Dutch. The spoken and written data are not perfectly
aligned, because they have been collected for different images. Hence, our study
should be seen as *exploratory*. The code in this repository is more general, though,
and could be used to analyze differences between other samples of spoken and written language.

## Reproduction
This folder contains all the code and data to reproduce the results from our paper.
There are two subfolders:

* `Dutch` contains all the code and data for the analysis of the Dutch descriptions.
* `English` contains all the code and data for the analysis of the English descriptions.

Both these folders contain `README.md` files with more detailed instructions.
